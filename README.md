# Unicorn_Hybrid_Black_data_handling
                          **This is an SSVEP project done by Unicorn headset**
The codes listed here are for handling the data recorded by a g.tec's Unicorn Hybrid Black headset whether they were saved as CSV of BDF. 
These codes are written in MATLAB 2021a, and most of processing is done through EEGLAB 2024.
The codes can convert CSV or BDF files to SET files, preprocess them, and create sorted epochs, which are later saved as CSVs in folders.
They also plot the time domain and frequency domain responses.
